# Linear Regression With Gradient Descendent

The jupyter notebook in this repository represents the simple version of linear regression and how can we use the scipy minimizer and also the Gradient Descent method
to tune the parameters of the model. I also showed how loss is changing at each iteration along with the RMSE value. This notebook hopefully will give a clear idea regarding the
basic formate of every machine learning model. This is a simple but elegant way to analyze and optimize the parameter of a model at a different angle.
